# Vector-Field-and-Divergence
-Vector field and divergence demonstration in Haskell using Gloss.
-Generates three different vector fields:
  1.) F(x,y) = <x,y> -- Source Field
  2.) F(x,y) = <-x,-y> -- Sink Field
  3.) F(x,y) = <5,10> -- Constant Field
-The program also shows the divergence for each field 
and their behavior for div(F) > 0, div(F) < 0, and div(F) = 0.
-Colors are used to signify the strength of the vector field;
blue being weak and yellow being strong.
-The magnitude of each vector is given to also signify the strength
of the field at certain points.
-Window appears to the right with information about the given field.
